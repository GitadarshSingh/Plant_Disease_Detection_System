## 📌 Overview

A deep learning–based web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images. Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed using **Streamlit Cloud** for instant access without local setup.

---

## 🧠 Features

* Image-based plant disease classification
* Trained CNN model for accurate predictions
* Clean and interactive Streamlit UI
* Publicly accessible web app (no localhost required)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Streamlit
* NumPy, OpenCV

---

## ▶️ How It Works

1. Open the live demo link
2. Upload a plant leaf image
3. Model analyzes the image
4. Disease prediction is displayed instantly
